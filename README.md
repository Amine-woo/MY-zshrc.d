# My personal zsh (and other) config

## Try it out!

That's right! You can take my zsh configuration for a spin _right now_, without clobbering your existing configuration!

Just clone this repository and run the `zsh` script at its root!

## Install it

This repository contains an ordered set of loadable zsh scripts. In order to install it, you need to add the lines contained in `zshrc.template` to your own `.zshrc`, making sure to have `ZSH_CONFIG_PATH` pointing to this repository.
